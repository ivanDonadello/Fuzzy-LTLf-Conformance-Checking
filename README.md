# Fuzzy-Conformance-Checking
A really fast conformance checker for fuzzy logs.

The code implements a fast conformance checker for fuzzy logs for the paper "Conformance Checking of Fuzzy Logs against Declarative Temporal Specifications".

## Usage
We tested the checker with `torch==1.13.1`. Once you installed PyTorch just donwload the code and run `python fuzzy_LTL_Stoch_Conf_Check_exp.py` for reproducing the results.
