# Fuzzy-Conformance-Checking
The code implements a fast conformance checker for fuzzy logs as described in the paper "Conformance Checking of Fuzzy Logs against Declarative Temporal Specifications".

## Usage
We tested the checker with `torch==1.13.1`. Once you installed PyTorch just donwload the code and run

`python fuzzy_LTL_Stoch_Conf_Check_exp.py`

for reproducing the results.
